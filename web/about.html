                As a responsible corporate citizen, Apollo Hospitals takes the spirit of leadership well beyond business
                and has embraced the responsibility of keeping India healthy. Recognizing that Non Communicable Diseases
                (NCDs) are the greatest threat to the nation, Apollo Hospitals is continuously educating people about
                preventive healthcare as the key to wellness. Likewise, envisioned by Dr. Prathap C Reddy, the "Billion

                Mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to provide "holistic healthcare" for the entire community starting
                from birth, through one's journey into childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.

                In a rare honour, the Government of India had issued a commemorative stamp in recognition of Apollo's
                widespread contributions, the first for a healthcare organization. In addition, a stamp was also
                released to mark the 15th anniversary of India's 1st successful liver transplant performed at Apollo
                Hospitals. More recently Apollo Hospitals was again honoured with a postal stamp for having successfully
                performed 20 million health checks and its pioneering efforts in encouraging preventive healthcare in
                the country.
